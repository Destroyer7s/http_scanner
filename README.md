# httprecon

This is a new personal project, so please suggest new features!

Python recon tool to scan for addresses that support HTTP and display helpful info. `httprecon` currently has minimal functionality.

I plan to add more checks to improve the accuracy of the scanner in the near future.

A basic demo (limited example to 4 addresses) can be found below:
